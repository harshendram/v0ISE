# 🏥 Multi-Agent Medical Assistant  
An AI-powered unified clinical support and learning platform

---

## 📌 Problem Statement
Healthcare professionals face growing patient loads, slow diagnostic workflows, and medical information scattered across PDFs, scans, reports, and research papers — making fast and accurate medical decisions difficult.  
This challenge is reinforced by the need for expert human validation to ensure clinical safety.

Medical students also struggle with fragmented learning resources. Concepts, disease information, and research are spread across textbooks, videos, and inconsistent online content, leading to slow, unstructured learning.

## ⚙ Technical Architecture

### 🧠 Multi-Agent System
Coordinated medical agents work together to handle:
- Differential diagnosis  
- Explanation generation  
- Retrieval-based reasoning  
- Image understanding  
- Research paper grounding  

### 🔍 Advanced RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
Uses:
- Docling parsing  
- Hybrid search  
- Cross-encoder re-ranking  
To deliver accurate, evidence-based clinical answers.

### 🩻 Medical Imaging Support
Supports automatic analysis of:
- X-rays  
- Skin lesion detection  

Results require human validation before being finalized.

### 👨‍⚕ Human-in-the-Loop Validation
Ensures safe and reliable clinical output by requiring medical professionals to verify diagnostic conclusions.

## 🔄 Tech Flow  
The tech flow diagram (page 4) shows the system pipeline:

1. User uploads data (text/image)  
2. Neural medical decoder → differential diagnosis  
3. Agents collaborate for reasoning & validation  
4. If medical image: image model predicts condition  
5. System waits for human validation  
6. Approved results stored → notes, 3D models, videos
